# Scatterplot React Application

This application is a simple React application that uses a `Scatterplot` component to display web metrics data.

## Scatterplot Component

The `Scatterplot` component is a custom component that takes in a `data` prop. This `data` prop is expected to be an array of objects, where each object represents a data point in the scatterplot.

The data for the `Scatterplot` component is generated by the `generateFakeWebMetrics` function. This function takes in a start date, an end date, and a number of data points to generate, and returns an array of data points between the start and end dates.

## NPM Scripts

Here are the main npm scripts you can use:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!** If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
